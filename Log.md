# Accuracy obtained with no addiotinal tunen (aka benchmark): 50.9000%


## Hyperparameters that were tuned but did not result in an increase in the accuracy

- lr:             0.00001
- weight-decay:   1e-7


## To investigate

### Normalization of one and no filliping horizontal flipping int test set: 42.2800%

### Model without dropout and normal fullyconnected layers ad proposed in the paper

### Check how the weight initialization is done, and kept between the appropiate values 

### Look for other convolutional libraries
